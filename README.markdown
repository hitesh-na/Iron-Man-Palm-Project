# Iron Man Arm Project

## Overview
Create a lightweight, wearable Iron Man-inspired hand and forearm armor featuring a glowing palm arc reactor, visible wires, and LED-lit accents. Built with EVA foam or 3D-printed parts, it integrates Arduino-controlled Neopixel LEDs and sensors for interactive lighting effects. Designed for comfort and aesthetics, this DIY project combines futuristic tech with a battle-worn look, perfect for display or tech enthusiasts.

### Project Goal
To create a lightweight, wearable Iron Man-inspired hand and forearm armor that:
1. Looks futuristic with visible wires, sensors, and glowing lights.
2. Functions as a wearable tech piece with interactive lighting effects.
3. Is comfortable to wear and easy to assemble using basic robotics tools and materials.
4. Does not include weapons (e.g., no repulsor beams or projectiles).

### Specifications

#### Design & Aesthetics
- **Material**: Lightweight EVA foam or 3D-printed parts for the armor.
- **Appearance**:
  - Visible "wires" and "sensors" on the forearm for a techy look.
  - Glowing palm and forearm accents (inspired by Iron Man's arc reactor and repulsor tech).
  - Weathering and detailing to mimic a battle-worn or high-tech suit.
- **Wearability**:
  - Adjustable straps (Velcro or elastic) for secure fit.
  - Lightweight construction to avoid strain on the arm.

#### Electronics & Functionality
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Nano or Uno for control.
- **Lighting**:
  - Palm: Neopixel LEDs for customizable colors and patterns.
  - Forearm: LED strips for accent lighting.
- **Sensors**:
  - Flex sensors on fingers to detect hand movement and trigger lighting effects.
  - Accelerometer/gyroscope (optional) for motion-based lighting (e.g., lights intensify when arm moves).
  - Push buttons (optional) for manual control of lighting modes.
- **Power**:
  - 9V battery or USB power bank for portability.
  - Power switch for easy on/off functionality.
- **Wiring**:
  - Decorative wires visible on the exterior for aesthetics.
  - Functional wires hidden inside the forearm casing.

#### Performance
- **Lighting Effects**:
  - Palm glows when fingers are bent (using flex sensors).
  - Forearm lights respond to motion or button presses.
  - Smooth transitions between colors (e.g., blue idle, red active).
- **Durability**:
  - Armor should withstand light wear and tear.
  - Electronics securely mounted to prevent disconnection.
- **Comfort**:
  - Lightweight design (total weight < 5000g).

#### Safety
- **Electrical Safety**:
  - Insulate all exposed wires and connections.
  - Use a battery with appropriate voltage and current ratings.
- **Physical Safety**:
  - Avoid obstructing hand movement or dexterity.
  - Ensure no small parts can detach and become choking hazards.

#### Cost & Accessibility
- **Budget**: Under $100 (depending on materials and components).
- **Tools Required**:
  - Basic crafting tools (hot glue gun, craft knife, sandpaper).
  - Arduino IDE for programming.

### Key Features
1. **Interactive Lighting**:
   - LEDs respond to hand movements or button presses.

2. **Futuristic Design**:
   - Visible wires and sensors for a high-tech look.
   - Glowing palm and forearm accents.
3. **Lightweight & Wearable**:
   - Easy to put on and take off.
   - Comfortable for extended wear.
4. **DIY-Friendly**:
   - Uses basic robotics components (Arduino, LEDs, sensors).
   - No advanced tools or materials required.

### Deliverables
1. **Physical Prototype**:
   - Wearable hand and forearm armor.
   - Functional electronics integrated into the design.
2. **Documentation**:
   - Step-by-step build guide.
   - Circuit diagram and parts list.

### Technicalities

#### Materials & Tools
- **Structure & Aesthetics**:
  - EVA foam (for lightweight armor) or 3D-printed parts.
  - Hot glue gun, craft knife, and sandpaper.
  - Decorative wires (old USB cables, ribbon cables, or LED strips for a techy look).
  - Fake sensors (salvaged circuit boards, 3D-printed doodads, or buttons).
  - Velcro straps or elastic bands for securing the armor to your arm.
- **Electronics**:
  - Arduino Nano/Uno (compact and easy to hide).
  - LEDs (Neopixel strips for programmable colors in the palm).
  - Sensors: Flex sensors (for finger movement), accelerometer/gyroscope (for arm motion), or push buttons.
  - 9V battery or USB power bank for power.
  - Wires, resistors (if needed), and conductive thread.

#### Design & Assembly
- **Step 1: Build the Hand Armor**
  - Palm & Fingers: Cut EVA foam into hand/finger shapes. Heat and mold it to fit your hand. Use a glove as a base for attaching foam pieces.
  - Forearm Casing: Create a hollow forearm armor piece to hide electronics. Add grooves or channels for routing wires.
- **Step 2: Install Lighting**
  - Palm Lights: Stick Neopixel LEDs inside the palm. Diffuse light with parchment paper or frosted acrylic for an arc reactor glow.
  - Accent Lighting: Add LED strips along the forearm edges for a "techy" vibe.
- **Step 3: Add Decorative Wires & Sensors**
  - Glue fake wires and sensors to the forearm armor. Use hot glue to create raised "circuitry" patterns.
  - Integrate real sensors (e.g., flex sensors on fingers) discreetly.

#### Electronics Setup
- **Circuit Diagram**: (Included in the project files as an image)
  - Connect sensors to Arduino inputs:
    - Flex sensors → Analog pins (with 10kΩ resistors).
    - Accelerometer → I2C pins (SDA/SCL).
    - LEDs → Digital PWM pins (use a MOSFET if using high-power LEDs).
  - Power Arduino and LEDs separately to avoid overload.
